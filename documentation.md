## Overall Process and Decision Making
- first steps were to break down problem based on assessment pdf instructions
    * performed in book_search.md
    * restate problem -> think of any possible questions -> id data structures -> think about assertions and edge cases -> pseudocode -> convert to js code -> walk through with test cases
- understand required tests and potential paths
    * understand that I am required to have three types of tests to confirm that my function is considering all potential inputs, outputs, and constraints: one of the most prominent being capitalization

## Testing and Iteration
### Strategy for Writing Tests
- need to write three kind of tests:
    1. positive (tests return match)
    2. negative (tests don't return matches)
    3. case-sensitive (tests that match for capitalization)

- Testing Strategies
    * Strategy 1
    * Strategy 2
